    <p>
      I started by hacking Improbable's hackernews clone to reverse engineer what's required to use gRPC for web.
      The goals were simple, learn more about gRPC and figure out how to connect from a server to an app.
      However, at the same time, I was faced with the reality that my neglected portfolio needed some serious love.
      With an impending move back to Australia, I didn't have time for both, so here we are...
    </p>
    <p>
      First step after messing with the hackernews app, was writing a proto file with the services and
      messages I would require and using this as the base for the rest of the project.
      Next time I'll spend longer at this stage. I can't overstate how critical it is to the whole project.
    </p>
    <AboutH4>server</AboutH4>
    <p>
      I chose Go for the server, as it is fast and easy to use.
      Keeping it relatively simple, while leaving scope for future hacking, I added BoltDB and the storm library,
      for easy CRUD operations.
    </p>
    <AboutH4>frontend</AboutH4>
    <p>
      The frontend consists of a React web app with a Redux store connected to gRPC middleware.
      The app is written in TypeScript, which is my preference for React projects,
      but also required to make use of the types generated by protoc.

      I'm a little obsessed with learning, perhaps forgetting more than I learn, but enjoying the process.
